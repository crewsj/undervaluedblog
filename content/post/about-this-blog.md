I finally set up my blog after thinking about it for a while. It was easy and cheap to do using the instructions on [Superfluous Sextant](http://superfluoussextant.com/how-to-make-blog.html). On the technical side, I decided to use [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io) instead of a Python static site generator[^hugo], even though I am a big fan of Python.

I started this blog in order to write about programming, data analysis, finance[^finance], sports, interesting articles, books I am reading, and whatever else comes to mind.[^politics] One of the models for this blog is [Daring Fireball](daringfireball.net). I like how Gruber links to stories and offers plenty of snark and also writes longer opinion pieces.[^sears]


### Footnotes

[^hugo]: The suggestion for using Hugo also came [Superfluous Sextant](http://superfluoussextant.com/).

[^finance]: Usual disclaimer here... I am not a financial expert or licensed in any way to give financial advice. The opinions expressed here are solely my own and should not be taken as financial advice. Consult a professional (ideally one with fiduciary duty to you) before making financial decisisions. 

[^sears]: I have always wanted to point out how ridiculous it is that [accepting a loan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-15/sears-borrows-400-million-from-lampert-s-esl-investments) from your CEO is a sign of trouble when [not accepting a loan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-24/lampert-stops-buying-sears-ious-as-cash-burns-corporate-finance) was also a sign of trouble 6 months earlier. Sears has plenty of problems, but my point is that the financial press (even publications I respect like Bloomberg) often look for correlations where there are none.

[^politics]: I am still undecided about political writing on here. Although [more](https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/) and [more](http://avc.com/2017/01/make-america-hate-again/) and [more](daringfireball.net) technical people are writing about political issues. I would highly recommend [Jeff Atwood's post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/) since it kind of mirrors my thinking.
