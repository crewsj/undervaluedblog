> Reading is not only the key to improving your lot in life, but it’s necessary if you want to develop insights, ideas, and understanding that sets you apart from others. You can’t however, **read what everyone else is reading**.

My only minor quibble here is that it should be stated: you can't *only* read what everyone else is reading. 

I am an engineer. I don't *get* art. However, I distinctly remember standing in a museum in Spain with fellow study abroad students. I was shocked at how *normal* Picasso's earlier works were[^Picasso]. Picasso to me was synonymous with cubism. A fellow student (Park Scholar, very bright) explained to me that you have to understand the rules before you can break them.

My point is that you shouldn't avoid reading what others are reading, and I doubt that is Shane's suggestion. There is even value in understanding what everyone is reading, and things become popular for a reason. Not everyone will be or wants to be the next Elon Musk or Richard Thaler, someone who has mastered Howard Mark's second-level thinking[^marks]. To master second-level thinking (if that is even possible) requires understanding the rules first.

[^parrish]: I would highly recommend subscribing to his weekly newsletter, available at [Farnam Street blog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/). Shane Parrish and [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) are the two main reasons I decided to start a blog. Oh and [Superfluous Sextant](http://superfluoussextant.com/).

[^Picasso]: And everyone is probably shocked at my lack of culture. I am an engineer! If I were trying to impress people in the wine and cheese crowd, I would talk about how these pieces were likely from his Blue Period or Rose Period. But I hang out with Bud Light[^sponsor] crowds, and these paintings seemed **_normal_** to me.

[^sponsor]: AB Inbev... sponsor? Call me.

[^marks]: More on this later but [here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2015-09-09-its-not-easy.pdf?sfvrsn=2) is one reference: "Different and better: that's a pretty good description of second-level thinking."
