If you are missing your fix of Malcolm Gladwell's voice[^gladwell], I would highly recommend this older episode of [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/malcolm-gladwell/):

> The principles of deliberate practice strike me as being most useful on questions like, “How to think?” So the whole notion that you would — when you have made a decision, when you have considered a set of data or evidence and drawn some conclusion — that you would submit your process to some kind of either internal or external review. I’m trying to figure out how to do a better job the next time. That strikes me as what we need. Because, you know, one of his observations about deliberate practice is that **practice becomes useless when it’s unreflective**. 

Gladwell discusses the misinterpretation of his interpretation of Anders Ericsson's work in [Outliers](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/). Many people focus on the 10,000 hour rule and believe Gladwell misinterpreted Ericsson's work. However, Gladwell's intent with Outliers was broader:

>But one is that I wanted people to move away from the notion of success as something individual. And I wanted to get people to understand that a lot of success has to do with chance, with the contribution of your culture, your generation, your family.

[^gladwell]: I would also highly recommend Gladwell's podcast [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/about/), specifically the episodes *Carlos Doesn't Remember*, *Food Fight*, and *My Little Hundred Million*.
