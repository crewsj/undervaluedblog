      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis is one of my favorite authors, and I typically look forward to his latest book. However, I was especially looking forward to &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2kdfVMN&#34;&gt;The Undoing Project&lt;/a&gt; since it is a book about Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. I became interested in behavioral economics&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:investing&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:investing&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a field Kahneman and Tversky revolutionized, after reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2l4O6YC&#34;&gt;Misbehaving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2l9AqaY&#34;&gt;The Little Book of Behavioral Investing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Undoing Project starts where &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2jP3Ytr&#34;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; left off, except this time with the story of the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. After the first chapter, I was telling people The Undoing Project would be Lewis&amp;rsquo; best book yet. However, after finishing the book, I have a hard time recommending it to anyone who has read &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2l9nTnP&#34;&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:tfs&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:tfs&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The most interesting parts were the stories about Israel and how the conflicts (Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, and others) affected Israeli citizens. Those stories made me want to read more about the history of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nate-silver-interviews-michael-lewis-about-his-new-book-the-undoing-project/&#34;&gt;538 podcast with Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt; my expectations were fairly high about the personal story in this book: the depth of the friendship between Kahneman and Tversky. I was surprised at the level of candor between the two friends, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the book exactly matched my expectations. If you are a fan of Michael Lewis or if you are unfamiliar with the work by Kahneman and Tversky, I would still recommend reading this book. It is, after all, a work by Michael Lewis, the greatest nonfiction writer of our time. It may not rank with his best (&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2jP3Ytr&#34;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2l4V0Nu&#34;&gt;Liar&amp;rsquo;s Poker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2jM6BB3&#34;&gt;The Big Short&lt;/a&gt;) but it is still an enjoyable read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:investing&#34;&gt;I used to think that personal investors could simply outperform the market by buying cheap (as measured by price/cash flow) and efficient (as measured by return on invested capital) companies. However, these days I believe buying undervalued stocks is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient condition. Pyschological advantages are the sufficient conditions. I have read many books on Warren Buffett and his letters to shareholders. I have never seen him write about hard and fast valuation metrics. I will need to dig up the quote by &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2k7UE4y&#34;&gt;Alice Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; but I think she claimed that he had written at least some metrics down for her but she couldn&amp;rsquo;t publish them until his death (&lt;em&gt;As I write that, it sounds like an alternative fact, so I could be imagining things&lt;/em&gt;). However, Buffett has written extensively about his pyschological advantages, and I believe that is the real source of his outperformance.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:tfs&#34;&gt;Full disclaimer here: I read parts of Thinking Fast and Slow but not cover to cover, which I hope to do soon.
